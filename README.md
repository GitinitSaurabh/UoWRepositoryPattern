# Repository Pattern and Unit of Work for Product Entity

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Unit of Work and Repository patterns for managing CRUD operations on a Product entity. 

## Why Use Unit of Work?

### Consistency

The Unit of Work pattern ensures a consistent approach to applying changes to the database. By centralizing the process, developers avoid scattered `SaveChanges()` calls, promoting database consistency.

### Atomicity

Grouping database changes into a single transaction ensures atomicity. With the Unit of Work pattern, either all changes are committed, or none are. This prevents scenarios where some operations succeed while others fail, maintaining a consistent database state.

### Reduced Database Roundtrips

Calling `SaveChanges()` after each operation can lead to increased database roundtrips, impacting performance. The Unit of Work pattern allows performing multiple operations before a single `SaveChanges()` call, minimizing roundtrips and enhancing application speed.

### Ease of Testing

Mocking the Unit of Work and Repositories simplifies unit testing. By isolating business logic from the database, developers can focus on testing functionality without accessing the actual database, promoting efficient and reliable testing practices.

### Decoupling

Decoupling business logic from data access logic enhances code cleanliness and maintainability. The Unit of Work pattern isolates database-related concerns, making it easier to manage and update code components independently.

## Transaction Management in Complete Method

The `_unitOfWork.Complete()` method efficiently handles multiple databases (e.g., Product, Orders, Customer) in a single transaction. Under the hood, it calls `_context.SaveChanges()`, which meticulously processes all tracked entities(goes through all the entities being tracked by the DbContext). This involves determining changes, generating SQL commands, and executing them in a single transaction.

If any part of the transaction fails, such as a concurrency conflict, none of the changes are committed. Conversely, if the transaction succeeds, all changes are committed, ensuring data integrity across multiple databases.

By utilizing the Unit of Work pattern, this repository exemplifies a robust and maintainable approach to handling database operations for the Product entity and beyond.
